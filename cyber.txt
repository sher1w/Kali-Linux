| 🛠 Fri (evening) | Learn 1 new cybersecurity topic                  | 1–2 hrs                 |
| 🚀 Sat           | Build mini side project / script                 | 2–3 hrs                 |
| 🔍 Sun           | Try a tool (Wireshark, Burp), fix bugs, document | 1–2 hrs                 |

> 🔁 Repeat weekly → you’ll build a portfolio in 4–6 weeks

### 🔥 Final Tips:

* 🚀 **Start small, but finish each thing** – even a 1-hour script/project counts
* 📓 Keep a **log of everything you try** – helpful for resume, reports, or LinkedIn posts
* 🎯 Focus on **real-world skills** not theory — what tools are used in companies?
* 🧑‍💻 Post even small wins online → shows you're active and growing
* ⏳ Don’t compare speed with others — **consistency wins**
