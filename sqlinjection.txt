SQL injection vulnerability allowing login bypass

Intial:
This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the login function.

To solve the lab, perform a SQL injection attack that logs in to the application as the administrator user.

administrator'--'
administrator'-- closes the string and comments out the rest of the SQL query.

-- is the SQL comment syntax, so anything after it (like the password check) is ignored.

This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in its stock check feature. The results from the query are returned in the application's response, so you can use a UNION attack to retrieve data from other tables.

The database contains a users table, which contains the usernames and passwords of registered users. To solve the lab, perform a SQL injection attack to retrieve the admin user's credentials, then log in to their account.
