Personal Note â€“ Sherwin Mazarlo

This document marks one of my initial uploads to GitHub outside of a virtual machine environment. I am currently exploring Git, GitHub, and core cybersecurity practices as part of my ongoing technical development.

My objective is to strengthen my understanding of secure software development, version control workflows, and Linux system administration. I believe consistent practice and hands-on experimentation are crucial in mastering these areas.

Thank you for visiting this repository. More structured and meaningful contributions will follow as I continue this learning journey.
